# Ramhacks2021
This is the fullstack project I developed along with other people during RamHacks 2021 and this project placed 3rd! I developed the back-end using Flask and SQLite, had someone else work on the front-end, and the last person assist with research and putting testing data into the databases.

In order to run the program, download Python and run the app.py file by typing python app.py into the console.

If everything is going well so far, you'll see a local IP address in the terminal! Feel free to use that same link to view the project! :)
